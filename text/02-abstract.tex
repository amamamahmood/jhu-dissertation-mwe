We demonstrate a realtime system that tracks the assembly of a 3D Lego\textsuperscript\textregistered{} block structure using a RealSense\textsuperscript\textregistered{} color $+$ depth camera. The system allows three control actions: \emph{Add, Remove and Adjust} on $2 \times 4 $ and $2 \times 4 $ Lego\textsuperscript\textregistered{} blocks of four basic colors (red, blue, green and yellow) to manipulate the 3D structure in the play area. 3D structures can be authored in \emph{Learning} mode for system to learn and tracking enables the robot to provide selected feedback in the \emph{Teaching mode} depending on the type of mistake made by the user. Proposed perception system is capable of detecting five types of mistakes i.e. mistake in: shape, color, orientation, level from base and position of the block.\\
The feedback provided by the robot is based on mistake made by the user. Either implicit or explicit feedback, chosen randomly, is narrated by the robot. Various feedback statements are designed to implicitly inform the user of the mistake made. Two robot behaviours have been designed to support the effective delivery of feedback statements. Nodding is used in conjunction with continuers i.e. \emph{Go on, Continue, Good, Hmm and Right} when the user action results in correct outcome. Whereas, referential gaze is employed along with the requisite feedback statement whenever the user commits a mistake during the assembly task. \\
We conducted an exploratory study to evaluate our robot assisted 3D block building system to augment spatial visualization skills with one participant. Major findings are that the system is easy to use. The robot was perceived as trustworthy, fun and interesting. When the mistakes are suggested in implicit ways, it results in better self-regulation and scaffolding of user's learning process. Intentions of the robot are communicated vividly through feedback statements and its behaviour i.e. nodding and referential gaze. \\
Furthermore, we discuss shortcomings of our system, compare it to few existing systems, discuss design implications and ways to improve it as future work. The observations from the study with one elementary-aged study are interesting contribution towards our future endeavours in the field of social robotics and education.
