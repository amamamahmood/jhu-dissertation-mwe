I wish to express my sincere appreciation to my advisor, Dr. Chien-Ming Huang for his guidance, time and encouragement throughout the process. I would also like to acknowledge Jindan Huang and Claudia Juliana Moncaliano for their assistance in implementation of the system. I wish to give due credit to my young cousin without whom I would not have been able to do this exploratory study. In the end, I would like to thank Fulbright Program for funding my masters degree and making it possible for me to be at the Johns Hopkins University.
